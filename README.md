# Earth Deadline

A countdown to the estimated time the planet is approaching 1.5C of global warming â€“ the point of no return. 1.5C of warming is a critical threshold, as it marks the increase in weather extremes, heat waves, extreme precipitation, and irreversible ice sheet loss. Sea levels also begin to rise sharply, with a chance that 2C of warming could wipe out virtually all corals.

The site currently features a clock counting down to January 2, 2028. The date estimated by the Human Impact Lab to be when the earth will heat by 1.5C.


## Work in progress
Currently, the site features a clock counting down to the date provided by the Human Impact Lab. Additional data regarding CO2 levels, greenhouse emissions, current air pollution levels, and the global temperature increase to come with future development.
